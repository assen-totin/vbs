REQUIREMENTS
============

1. GTK+ 2.2 or above. 

2. pkg-config.  

3. gcc. Any recent version whould be OK (tested: 4.1.1 on Fedora Core 5, 4.5.1 
   on Fedora 14, i4.7.2 on FEdora 17). 

4. make from autoconf tools.

5. GStreamer or MPlayer. 
   - For GStreamer, the follwoing two packages are required: gstreamer-0.10 
     and gstreamer-interfaces-0.10
   - For MPlayer, the binary of the non-gui version should be installed in 
     your path and should be  named "mplayer".


INSTALLATION
============

1. ./configure

     --enable-mlayer=yes|no (default: yes on POSIX and no on Windows)

     --enable-gstreamer=0.10|1.0|no (default: on POSIX, try 1.0, if not found, 
     try 0.10; on Windows, try 0.10)

     --enable-gtk=2|3 - force GTK version to compile against. If both 2 and 3 
       are available, 3 will be used by default.

2. make

3. (as root) make install

The binaries are called "vbsm", "vbss", "vbsc" and "vbsd". Menu entries will be installed for you.


BUILDING RPM
============

To build an RPM file, call "make rpm" after "make". 

Also, for rpm you'd probably like to call ./configure this way:
     ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

In regards to RPM, only the following "./configure" options have effect:
--prefix
--exec-prefix
--bindir
--sbindir
--sysconfdir
--datarootdir
--localedir


BUILDING FOR MS WINDOWS
=======================

To build for MS Windows (32-bit) on 32-bit Linux, run these commands:

    ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --build=i686-redhat-linux \
                --enable-backend=gstreamer
    make
    make exe

To build for MS Windows (64-bit) on 62-bit Linux, run ./configure like this:

    ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --build=x86_64-redhat-linux \
                --enable-backend=gstreamer

Notes: 

* Build was tested in MinGW, using cross-compilation under Linux with the 
  Fedora 18-supplied packages of w64. NSIS installer is required to build the 
  EXE file. 

* Both GTK2 and GTK3 are supported, you can force the one preferred. Otherwise
  GTK3 will be attempted, if missing, GTK2 will be used.
  
* MinGW only provides GStreamer 0.10 and not 1.0. However, there is automatic
  fallback from 1.0 to 0.10, so you don't have to force GStreamer version. 
  
* The EXE file will contain not only the VBS executables, bul all DLLs for
  GTK, GStreamer et al.

* Because MS Windows is not POSIX compliant, vbsd will not be built. 

* Because MS Windows is not POSIX compliant, MPLayer is not supported as 
  backend. Because normally support for both will be built, here GStreamer 
  has to be forced as a single backend. 


UNINSTALL
=========

make uninstall
