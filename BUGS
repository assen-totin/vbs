This program is a quick-n-dirty hack, there may well be lots of bugs. 

Also, the coding style is far from ideal - be warned. 

Should you find any, send an email. See AUTHOR for details. 



KNOWN ISSUES (and solutions):

1. With many AVI files, seek is not precise (5 seconds or more). This is due to the 
reduced number of key frames. Re-encode your with with one key frame at least each 
12-15 frames.

2. When you double-click and move to the last subtitle before current and then start the playback, 
the subtitle is not shown by mplayer. This seems to be an mplayer issue; the subtitles are
actually reloaded. If you double-click 3-4 subtitles before current, you'll see them 
displayed properly.
