Also, the coding style is far from ideal - be warned.



KNOWN ISSUES (and solutions):

1. With many AVI files, seek is not precise (5 seconds or more). This is due to 
the reduced number of key frames. Re-encode your with with one key frame at 
least each 12-15 frames.

2. When you double-click and move to the last subtitle before current and then 
start the playback, the subtitle is not shown by mplayer. This seems to be an 
mplayer issue; the subtitles are actually reloaded. If you double-click 3-4 
subtitles before current, you'll see them displayed properly.

3. The SDL video output for GStreamer sometimes fails to integrate with the main
program window and opens in a separate one (like MPLayer). If this happens, try 
another video output.
