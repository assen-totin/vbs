REQUIREMENTS
============

1. GTK+ 2.2 or above. 

2. pkg-config.  

3. gcc. Any recent version whould be OK (tested: 4.1.1 on Fedora Core 5, 4.5.1 
   on Fedora 14, i4.7.2 on FEdora 17). 

4. make from autoconf tools.

5. GStreamer or MPlayer. 
   - For GStreamer, the follwoing two packages are required: gstreamer-0.10 
     and gstreamer-interfaces-0.10
   - For MPlayer, the binary of the non-gui version should be installed in 
     your path and should be  named "mplayer".


INSTALLATION
============

1. ./configure

     --enable-backend=mlayer,gstreamer - compile only MPlayer or GStreamer as 
       back-end (by default, GStreamer will be compiled if available and 
       MPlayer will always be compiled).

     --enable-gtk=2,3 - force GTK version to compile against. If both 2 and 3 
       are available, 3 will be used by default.

2. make

3. (as root) make install

The binaries are called "vbsm", "vbss", "vbsc" and "vbsd". Menu entries will be installed for you.


BUILDING RPM
============

To build an RPM file, call "make rpm" after "make". 

Also, for rpm you'd probably like to call ./configure this way:
     ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

In regards to RPM, only the following "./configure" options have effect:
--prefix
--exec-prefix
--bindir
--sbindir
--sysconfdir
--datarootdir
--localedir


BUILDING FOR MS WINDOWS
=======================

To build for MS Windows, run these commands:

    ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --build=i686-redhat-linux --enable-gtk=2 \
                --enable-backend=gstreamer
    make
    make exe

Notes: 

* Build was tested in MinGW, using cross-compilation under Linux with the Fedora
  17-supplied packages of w64. NSIS installer is required to build the .exe. 

* Only GTK2 is supported as MinGW has no builds of GTK3 for the moment. 
  Because under other OS GTK3 is default, here GTK2 has to be forced.

* The .exe file will contain not only the VBS executables, bul all DLLs for
  GTK, GStreamer et al.

* Because MS Windows is not POSIX compliant, vbsd will not be built. 

* Because MS Windows is not POSIX compliant, MPLayer is not supported as 
  backend. Because under other OS support for both will be built, here 
  GStreamer has to be forced as a single backend. 


UNINSTALL
=========

make uninstall
