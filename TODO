PENDING:

1. Make the TreeView (the subtitle list) non-clickable when the status is 
RUNNING (requires a deeper dig in GTK+; might not be possible at all).

2. Fix the network server dialog, which closes if the server name cannot be
resolved. It is better to keep it open and allow re-eentry of server name, 
but probably requries too much coding.
