NOTES TO MAINTAINERS OF VBS

Please, read the INSTALL file first. It contains important notes on working with 
the distributed archives (.tar.gz).

If you are dealing with the very raw source code, read on.

TRANSLATIONS
============
Standard gettext is used. "make dist" will update the .mo files from
existing .po files. 


HELP
===
Help is maintained in DocBook format, one file per language - see help/docbook

Help is distributed in 3 flavours: 
- For Linux + GNOME users: the docbooks themselves get fed to yelp.
- For Linux users without yelp: a text-only help (one file per language) that 
will be displayed in a GTK widget. 
- For Windows users: CHM files, one file per language.

To produce the text-only help from DocBook help: 

   cd help; make help_textonly

To produce the CHM help from DocBook help: 
- install the FreePascal compiler, it will give you the chmcmd utility
- install the preshrinked-cotton Python package, it will give you the tt2chm 
helper script: http://code.google.com/p/preshrunk-cotton (it depends on 'textile'
package, install it too).
- then run

   cd help; make help_chm

When installing on Linux (incl. when building an RPM), both text-only and 
DocBook help will be both installed. At runtime VBS will attempt to use yelp,
if it is missing, it will show the text-only help.


BUILDING A DISTRIBUTION
=======================
You need to have: 
- all the language files for help (DocBook, text-only, CHM)
- the .po files for translations.

Then run:

   make dist
