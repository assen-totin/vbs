INSTALLATION
============

1. ./configure

     --enable-backend=mlayer,gstreamer - compile only MPlayer or GStreamer as 
       back-end (by default, GStreamer will be compiled if available and 
       MPlayer will always be compiled).

     --enable-gtk=2,3 - force GTK version to compile against. If both 2 and 3 
       are available, 3 will be used by default.

2. make

3. (as root) make install

The binaries are called "vbsm", "vbss", "vbsc" and "vbsd". Menu entries will be installed for you.


RPM
===

To build an RPM file, call "make rpm" after "make". 

Also, for rpm you'd probably like to call ./configure this way:
     ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

In regards to RPM, only the following "./configure" options have effect:
--prefix
--exec-prefix
--bindir
--sbindir
--sysconfdir
--datarootdir
--localedir


UNINSTALL
=========

make uninstall
