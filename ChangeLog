Dec 31, 2012 - Version 3.1
==========================

1. Shortcut changes: removed Ctrl+V for "Load Video" to avoid conflict with 
system "paste" command; removed "Del" for "Delete current subtitle" to allow
the "Del" key to be used when editing the text of a subtitle; moved "Ctrl+0"
from "Zero timing for current" to "Zero timing from current" because the
latter is more often used.

2. Behaviour changes: "Zero timing from current" will now also zero the timing
for the current subtitle.

3. Changed the GUI when using GStreamer to preserve the original video size.

4. Added menu option "Edit -> Shift Timing from Current". All subtitles from
currently selected one will be shifted with the specified offset (in 
milliseconds). If a timing becomes negative, it will be set to zero.

5. Added menu option "Edit -> Expand Timing from Current". The start and end
time for each subtitle will be multipiled by the factor specified.

6. Added buttons to move the movie fwd or back 1 or 10 minutes ane also to
jump to the beginning of it.

7. Added support for GStreamer 1.0. If GStreamer is enabled, first ver. 1.0 
will be sought and if not found, ver. 0.10 will be attempted. 

Nov 14, 2012 - Version 3.0
==========================

1. Support GTK3 as well as GTK2. Choice will be made at compile time. If both 
are available, GTK3 will be used unless GTK2 is forced with the --enable-gtk=2 
configure options.

2. Support for GStreamer for video playback. By default, if GStreamer is 
available, support for it will be built and also for MPlayer. To compile only 
one of them, use the --enable-backend=mplayer,gstreamer configuration option. 
Support multiple video output methods for GStreamer - X11 (ximagesink), Xv 
(xvimagesink), SLD (sdlvideosink), Auto (autovideosink). 

3. Windows support, cross-compiled in Linux using MinGW32. The Windows build
has few limitations: vbsd is not available; GTK-2 only is supported (no GTK-3 
yet); GStreamer is the only player supported (no MPLayer).

4. Support for i18n via gettext. Provided translations for Bulgarian, Russian, 
English. Also added i18n support for help: DocBoox for GNOME (yelp), CHM
for Windows and plain text for GTK-only. 

5. Full autoconf support, automake now also supported.

6. vbss improvements: font family & face selection, font colour and background
selection, font justification selection (all via vbsc).

7. vbsd now can be started by a SystemV init or by systemd. Proper startup 
scripts are provided. 

8. vbsm now has a progress bar update configuration option.

9. vbss now has subtitle update configuration option (config file only, not via
vbsc).


Oct 9, 2012 - Version 2.2
==========================

1. Small code improvements (desktop files, icons placement). 

Mar 8, 2012 - Version 2.1
==========================

1. Added workaround for mplayer not detecting UTF8 in subtitles

2. Fixed mplayer crash due to a negative (or too large) timing occuring when 
the first subtitle is double-clicked and start time is less than the go-back 
offset.

3. Improved handling when last line of text is reached

Mar  1, 2012 - Version 2.0
==========================

1. Renamed vbs to vbsm ("master" client). Added networking for sending current 
subtitle to vbsd daemon.

2. Added vbsd daemon - simple daemon to store the last subtitle, from where it 
can be retrieved by the vbss ("slave" client).

3. Added vbss - client for showing same subtitles in multiple locations.

4. Added autoconf support (but no automake).

5. Disabled keyboard controls for mplayer

Aug 27, 2006 - Version 1.0
==========================
