REQUIREMENTS

1. GTK+ 2.2 or above (including header files; for users of RPM, check that *-devel* packages
   are installed. 

2. pkg-config. (Yes, I also don't like it, but it is much easier to deal will all various
   GTK layouts). If you don't have it, here is what I get from mine: 

   [root@archimed vbs]# pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0
   -I/usr/include/gtk-2.0 -I/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/include -I/usr/include/atk-1.0 -I/usr/include/cairo 
   -I/usr/include/pango-1.0 -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/glib-2.0/include  
   -lgtk-x11-2.0 -lgdk-x11-2.0 -latk-1.0 -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0 -lm -lpangocairo-1.0 -lpango-1.0 
   -lcairo -lgobject-2.0 -lgmodule-2.0 -ldl -lglib-2.0

   You can tweak the Makefile to make it work without the pkg-config.

3. gcc. Any recent version whould be OK (tested: 4.1.1 on Fedora Core 5). 

4. make. This programme does not use autoconf - everything is ready in the Makefile. 
   Feel free to modify it according to your own taste. 

5. mplayer. The binary of the non-gui version should be installed in your path and should be 
   named "mplayer". To change the name, edit the video.h file.



INSTALLATION

Just run "make", then "make install". 

The binary is called "vbs". If you are using Gnome, a menu entry will be installed for you.



UNINSTALL

Run "make uninstall" to remove all files.
