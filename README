Voody Blue Subtitler (aka VBS) is a simple programme that allows you to manually 
synchronize a text file with a video stream, thus creating a subtitles file. 

It was coded for just a couple of days when I found myslef in need of such 
application and failed to find anything suitable in the Net. Therefore, it is limited
in features and is designed to match my own working habbits and preferences. 

VBS uses a small plain-text config, stored in ~/.vbs/config. It is generated when VBS
is run fo rthe the first time. Do not edit this file unless you are told to do so.

The input file should be ether text-only (one subtitle per line) or SubRip format.
It can utilize either single-byte encoding or UTF-8. The best way to produce a
file with single-byte encoding is to save it from your favourite word processor
setting the appropriate encoding. By default, VBS treats the input file as 
cp1251-encoded. To change it, use the Text/Set Encoding menu. The lines of the 
input file may be either <CR> ot <CR><LF> terminated.

If you wish to have a subtitle split into two lines at an exact position (not 
where your player decides), insert a pipe character "|" at the desired position.
When exporting the subtitles, VBS will replace it with a newline character. 

The output file is in SubRip format. It was chosen because it is frame-rate  
independent (yes, I agree that these stupid numbers preceding each subtitle are just 
a waste of time) and matches best the way the subtitles list is managed by the VBS
internally. The default export encoding is single-byte, cp1251. To change it, use 
the Export/Set Encoding menu.

By default, the lines in the output file will be <LF> terminated. If you need a 
<CR><LF> format, set it from the Expot/Set Newline Char menu. 

VBS has a simple interface: 

1. A status bar showing whether the movie s running or paused. When you first start it, 
   it pauses at the beginning of the movie. Press spacebar to start playing. You can 
   pause the playback at any time by againg pressing spacebar; however, you can only 
   pause the playback between subtitles, when one is inserted and not yet retrieved. 

2. A progress bar showing a recommended duration for each subtitle. If the subtitle 
   is not retrieved after the suggested time, a counter of the total duration of the
   subtitle is also displayed. 

3. A list of lines, read from the input file together with their entry and exit times
  (initially all zeroes). The subtitle which is ready to be entered is highlighted. 
  To insert the subtitle, press "b". To retrieve it and prepare the next, press "m".
  To retrieve it and insert the next, press "n".  
      
  When playback is paused, you can use double click any of the first two columns of a 
  processed subtitle (i.e. columns which have values, greater than zero) to move 
  1 second  before its entry time. While playing, you'll see the subtitles displayed 
  by mplayer and will also see the the current subtitle being highlighted. 

  To edit the text of a subtitle on the spot, double click the column containg the 
  text. With MPEG files this works pretty OK (they usually have a keyframe every 1/2 
  second). However, with AVI files seek precision often lies somewhere around 5 seconds 
  meaning with AVI files you may have to go back 1-2 subtitles earlier - or re-encode 
  it in a more suitable fashion.

  Whenever you press the "m" or "n" key, VBS automatically exports the subtitles 
  list. Therefore you don't have to save anything on exit (or crash :). You can still
  force exporting by pressing the "s" key. Each export overrides the previous one. 

4. Menu bar. 

  The File/Quit exits the programme.

  To insert a new empty subtitle before/after current or to delete current subtitle,
  use the entries in the Edit menu. In the same menu you can zero the counters for
  the currently selected subtitle or for all subtitles from current on. 

  To import a plain text or SubRip text file, use the entries in the Text menu.
  Also use it t specify encoding for the text files.

  To load a video file, use the Video/Load menu.

  To set an export destination, use the Export menu. Default is usually 
  "/tmp/vbs_export.srt". Also use it to specify encoding for the exported file and
  to set the newline character (default <LF>).

  To get some help, use the Help/Contents menu.
