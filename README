Voody Blue Subtitler (aka VBS) is a suit of programmes that allow you toМ
- manually synchronize a text file with a video stream, thus creating a subtitles file;
- play back a subtitle file
- relay the subtitles through a small server to muliple clients

VBS consists of several pieces: 
- vbsm - the "master" client which can do the timing of subtitles, with or without
video playback
- vbss - the "slave" client, which can play back a subtitle file or can receive 
subtitles from a server and show them in real time
- vbsd - the server which relay the subtitles.

VBS uses a small plain-text config, stored in ~/.vbs/config. It is generated when VBS
is run for the the first time. Do not edit this file unless you are told to do so.
Both vbsm and vbss share this file; vbsd keeps its own config file (of the same format) 
in /etc/vbs/config. 

You can force the usage of a different config file through the -f (or --config) 
command-line option. 

A. vbsm
-------

The input file should be ether text-only or SubRip format. VBS can utilize either 
single-byte encoding or UTF-8. The best way to produce a suitable file is to save it 
from your favourite word processor setting the appropriate encoding. By default, 
VBS treats the input file as UTF-8 encoded. To change it, use the "Text/Set Encoding" 
menu. The lines of the input file may be either <CR> ot <CR><LF> terminated, VBS will 
handle both. 

If you wish to have a subtitle split into two lines at an exact position (not 
where your player decides), insert a pipe character "|" at the desired position.
When exporting the subtitles, VBS will replace it with a newline character. 

The output file is in SubRip format. It was chosen because it is frame-rate  
independent (yes, I agree that these stupid numbers preceding each subtitle are just 
a waste of time) and matches best the way the subtitles list is managed by the VBS
internally. The default export encoding is UTF-8. To change it, use the "Export/Set
Encoding" menu.

By default, the lines in the output file will be <LF> terminated. If you need a 
<CR><LF> format, set it from the "Expot/Set Newline Char" menu. 

vbsm has a simple interface: 

1. A status bar showing whether the movie is running or paused. When you first start it, 
   it pauses at the beginning of the movie. Press spacebar to start playing. You can 
   pause the playback at any time by againg pressing spacebar; however, you can only 
   pause the playback between subtitles, when one is inserted and not yet retrieved. 

2. A progress bar showing a recommended duration for each subtitle. If the subtitle 
   is not retrieved after the suggested time, a counter of the total duration of the
   subtitle is also displayed. 

3. A list of lines, read from the input file together with their entry and exit times
  (initially all zeroes). The subtitle which is ready to be entered is highlighted. 
  To insert the subtitle, press "b". To retrieve it and prepare the next, press "m".
  To retrieve it and insert the next, press "n".  
      
  When playback is paused, you can use double click any of the first two columns of a 
  processed subtitle (i.e. columns which have values, greater than zero) to move 
  1 second  before its entry time. While playing, you'll see the subtitles displayed 
  by mplayer and will also see the the current subtitle being highlighted. 

  To edit the text of a subtitle on the spot, double click the column containg the 
  text. With MPEG files this works pretty OK (they usually have a keyframe every 1/2 
  second). However, with AVI files seek precision often lies somewhere around 5 seconds 
  meaning with AVI files you may have to go back 1-2 subtitles earlier - or re-encode 
  it in a more suitable fashion.

  Whenever you press the "m" or "n" key, VBS automatically exports the subtitles 
  list. Therefore you don't have to save anything on exit (or crash :). You can still
  force exporting by pressing the "s" key. Each export overrides the previous one. 

4. Menu bar. 

  The File/Quit exits the programme.

  To insert a new empty subtitle before/after current or to delete current subtitle,
  use the entries in the Edit menu. In the same menu you can zero the counters for
  the currently selected subtitle or for all subtitles from current on. 

  To import a plain text or SubRip text file, use the entries in the Text menu.
  Also use it t specify encoding for the text files.

  To load a video file, use the Video/Load menu.

  To set an export destination, use the Export menu. Default is usually 
  "/tmp/vbs_export.srt". Also use it to specify encoding for the exported file and
  to set the newline character (default <LF>).

  To send the subtitles to a vbds server, set the server name and port in the "Network"
  menu; also, there is the entry to enable or disable network. 

  To get some help, use the Help/Contents menu.

B. vbss
-------

vbss is a small program which displays subtitles. It is most useful when run in 
fullscreen with PC/laptop video output using projector to overlay subtitles over
another motion picture. 

vbss has no GUI - it opens in fullscreen, showing white subtitles on a black background.
For testing pusposes, an option on the config file called FULL_SCREEN exists; if set to 0, 
vbss will start in windowed mode and will use smaller font size. 

The font size can be changed specified in the config file, as well as the background and 
foreground colours (not very useful in practice).

vbss can operate in two modes depending config setting. 

- If RECV_FROM_NETWORK is 1, vbss will try to contact a vbsd server set in SERVER_NAME at 
the specified TCP_PORT. It will poll the server each second, displaying whatever the server 
is streaming wight now. 

- If RECV_FROM_NETWORK is 0, vbss will try to load the file specified in IMPORT_FILENAME 
(it should be in SubRip format) and play it back. In addition, if SEND_TO_NETWORK is 1, 
vbss will send the subtitles to the specified server and port. 

You cannot have both RECV_FROM_NETWORK and RECV_FROM_NETWORK set to 1 at the same time.

When playing back a local file, the playbak will not start until you press once the space 
bar (a prompt will be shown on screen). Once the playback begins, the follwing hot keys are 
available:
- space: toggle pause/playback
- k: jump one minute forward
- j: rewind one minute

C. vbsd
-------

vbsd is a text relay daemon. It will bind to the port, specified in TCP_PORT in its config 
and will then listen for queries, which can be:

- a "push" request - from vbsm - then vbsd will store the subtitle it has received. vbsd only 
stores one subtitle a time. When a subtitle goes off screen, vbsm sends a newline to clear the
vbsd storage. vbsm will prepend a magic key to the subtitle, which vbsd will try to match 
againts the MAGIC_KEY from its config file. The subtitle will be stored only upon match.

- a "pull" request - from vbss - then vbsd will send the current subtitle it stores. Any 
request which does nto begin with correct magic key will be treated as "pull" request.
