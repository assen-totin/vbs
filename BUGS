Should you find any bug, send an email. See AUTHOR for details. 

Also, the coding style is far from ideal - be warned.



KNOWN ISSUES (and solutions):

1. With many AVI files, seek is not precise (5 seconds or more). This is due to 
the reduced number of key frames. Re-encode your with with one key frame at 
least each 12-15 frames.

2. When you double-click and move to the last subtitle before current and then 
start the playback, the subtitle is not shown by mplayer. This seems to be an 
mplayer issue; the subtitles are actually reloaded. If you double-click 3-4 
subtitles before current, you'll see them displayed properly.

3. The SDL video output for GStreamer sometimes fails to integrate with the main
program window and opens in a separate one (like MPLayer). If this happens, try 
another video output. 

4. GTK-3 has a bug which prevents the application to change the main window's 
background colour when the GTK theme uses umages for background. This means
that vbss might not be able to set the baclground colour to black (which is 
required to block the excessivle light when superimposing subtitles by 
projection). Possible workarounds: 
- swich to a GTK theme which does not use images for window backgrounds
- swich to a GTK theme which has black window backgrounds
- use GTK2.
