PENDING:

1. Make the TreeView (the subtitle list) non-clickable when the status is 
RUNNING (requires a deeper dig in GTK+; might not be possible at all).

2. Have a nicer help. There are several ways, each with some drawbacks: 

* use yelp as help browser: yelp is usually tightly connected to GNOME, but I
  would like to keep VBS a GTK-only application.

* use GTK-webkit: webkit only recently became available and is a hefty 
requirement for showing a few pages of help. In addition, it is not always
available in GTK2.

* use GtkHTML: it is deprecated and only available in GTK2.

3. Fix the network server dialog, which closes if the server name cannot be
resolved. It si better to keep it open and allow re-eentry of server name, 
but probably requries too much coding.
