Should you find any bug, send an email. See AUTHORS for details. 

Also, the coding style is far from ideal - be warned.



KNOWN ISSUES (and solutions):

1. With many AVI files, seek is not precise (5 seconds or more). This is due to 
the reduced number of key frames. Re-encode your with with one key frame at 
least each 12-15 frames.

2. When you double-click and move to the last subtitle before current and then 
start the playback, the subtitle is not shown by mplayer. This seems to be an 
mplayer issue; the subtitles are actually reloaded. If you double-click 3-4 
subtitles before current, you'll see them displayed properly.

3. The SDL video output and the "Auto" video output for GStreamer will not 
integrate with the main program window and open the video in a separate one 
(like MPLayer). The first is a limitation of SDL, the second is a due to 
GStreamer's internal design. Use different output if possible.  

4. GTK-3 has a bug which prevents the application to change the main window's 
background colour when the GTK theme uses umages for background. This means
that vbss might not be able to set the baclground colour to black (which is 
required to block the excessivle light when superimposing subtitles by 
projection). A work-around is implemented in the code. Other possible solutions: 
- swich to a GTK theme which does not use images for window backgrounds
- swich to a GTK theme which has black window backgrounds
- use GTK-2. 

5. On Windows Theora codec is missing.  This is an upstream bundling bug - the
codec is missing the official GStreamer release. Either re-encode with other
video codec or wait for the next release which will eventually fix it.

6. On Windows the help files' TOC is displayed incorrectly for non-Latin 
charsets. This is a Windows Help viewer (hh.exe) limitation which only supports 
ANSI characters. No workaround possible, complain to Miscrosoft.
